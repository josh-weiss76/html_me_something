                  <p>
                      My journey began on July 16, 1996 when my dad dropped me off at the recruiting station in Orlando, Florida.
                      It was 6 in the morning and I was about to ship off for Basic Combat Training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missorri.
                      This was the first step in my incredible journey, which has taken me around the country and the world.

                      The first stop on my journey, was the Tampa Military Entrance Processing Station.
                      I completed the final physical exams and was issued my plane ticket to Chicago, Illinois.
                      This would be my first time ever flying on a commercial airline.

                      Upon arriving at the Chicago Airport, the other recruits and I were put on buses bound for
                      Fort Leonard Wood and Basic Combat Training.  This was also our first introduction to Drill Sergeants, and their
                      special brand of motivational speaking.

                  <p>
                      The bus ride was a blur, it was the middle of the night and we were all nervous, anxious, and excited.
                      We arrived at the Fort Leonard Wood recruit processing station at around 5 in the morning, and immediately began our second day in the Army.
                      This included analytical tests, physical exams, immunizations, clothing issue, and a whole lot of waiting.
                      The next several days were spent with the inprocessing unit, preparing for Basic Combat Training, and waiting for the next class to begin.

                  <p>
                      When basic training began, the only thing that I expected was that it was going to be physically and mentally challenging.
                      But after 8 long weeks of little sleep, long runs, ruck marches, haricuts, and daily physical smoke sessions, we graduated on
                      September 19, 1996.

                      My dad drove up for the graduation, and I was able to spend some time with him the night before the graduation ceremony.
                      We had a nice dinner on post and I was so happy to be able to spend that time with him.  After the graduation ceremony,
                      I was so excited to be done with basic training, that I completely forgot how to salute an Officer, and used my left hand.
                      I immediately realized my mistake, and saluted with the correct hand.  Dad drove me back home to Orlando, since I was able to take a
                      week of leave before begining language training in California.  I don't remember much about the ride home, we talked for a little bit,
                      and I slept for the majority of the drive.

                      When we got back to Florida, I spent several days hanging out with friends and family, telling stories about Basic Training and the friends
                      that I had made there.  My dad helped me plan my cross country drive from Orlando, Florida to the Presidio of Monterey, California.
                      I left for my cross country trip in my 1994 Chevrolet Camaro early in the morning on Tuesday, September 24.  I arrived at the Presidio of
                      Monterey on the morning of Friday, September 27.

                      </a>.  The language training began with learning the basice Russian alphabet and grew from there.  After a
                      couple of weeks, I was able to speak and understand basic commands and sentences.  My class started with 10 students, which over time dwindled to four.
                      Some students from previous classes were added, they had to restart for various reasons, and the class graduated with six students.

                      After graduating from the Defense Language Institute, Foreign Language Center, I drove to Goodfellow Air Force Base (GAFB), Texas to begin my
                      Advanced Individual Training (AIT) as a Signals Intelligence Analyst.  The course took almost six months to complete and was comprised of two
                      phases, with the first phase taking place at GAFB.  The second phase took place at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  After almost two years of training,
                      I finally graduated from AIT and was considered a full-fledged Soldier.

                      Fort Bliss, Texas, back to Fort Meade, Maryland, and finally Fort Gordon, Georgia.  I have had the opportunity to see Russia, Ukraine, and
